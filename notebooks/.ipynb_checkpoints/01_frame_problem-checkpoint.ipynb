    "- **Reduce financial losses** caused by fraud by quickly detecting fraudulent activities.\n",
    "- **Improve operational efficiency** by automating fraud detection processes, allowing businesses to focus on legitimate transactions.\n",
    "- **Enhance customer trust** by ensuring secure and reliable transactions, which can result in better customer retention and brand reputation.\n",
    "- **Minimize false positives**, reducing the number of legitimate transactions wrongly flagged as fraud, thus avoiding customer dissatisfaction and unnecessary manual reviews.\n",
