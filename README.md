# Project
**FraudGuard**: Real-Time Fraud Detection for Financial Transactions

# Purpose
The goal is to build a **machine learning model** to detect fraudulent transactions using synthetic financial datasets, helping businesses identify and mitigate fraud risks.

# Description
Financial institutions face challenges in **detecting fraud** due to limited access to real-world data and imbalanced datasets.<br>
This project uses <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1">synthetic financial data</a> that simulates real-world transactions, including fraudulent activities, to train a fraud detection model.<br>
The model will help detect and prevent fraud in **financial transactions**.

# Business Problem
Fraudulent transactions pose significant risks to businesses and customers. The problem is:<pre>
How can we accurately identify fraudulent financial transactions in real-time?
</pre>

# Objectives
- Analyse and understand this financial dataset.
- Build and train machine learning models for fraud detection.
- Evaluate the model's performance.
- Provide a deployable fraud detection solution for businesses.
